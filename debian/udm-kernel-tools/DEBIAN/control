Description: Tools for bootstrapping custom kernels on the UniFi Dream Machine
 This package provides tools for bootstrapping custom kernels on the UniFi
 Dream Machine and UniFi Dream Machine Pro from Ubiquiti.
 .
 Replacing the kernels on these devices is not trivial due to the restrictions
 on the bootloader and root filesystems of these devices. This package works
 around these issue by having the stock kernel act as a second stage bootloader
 for custom kernels.
